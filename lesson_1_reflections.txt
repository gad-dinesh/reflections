How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    can list out what is the differnece between two files, and in case of typos it is easy to find via comparing.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    can identify when the bug was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros. no need to worry abt the process of save
    cons. there will be too many versions even for small change of logic

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    google doc is not a repo.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will display all the changes done on the file.
    git diff will show the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    V.C has all the changes that i've doen to the project. 
    on proper commit stratergy i can always go back to the code which worked properly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
